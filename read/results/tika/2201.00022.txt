ABSTRACT

Most stellar evolution models predict that black holes (BHs) should not exist above approximately

50− 70 M�, the lower limit of the pair-instability mass gap. However, recent LIGO/Virgo detections
indicate the existence of BHs with masses at and above this threshold. We suggest that massive

BHs, including intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), can form in galactic nuclei through collisions

between stellar-mass black holes and the surrounding main-sequence stars. Considering dynamical

processes such as collisions, mass segregation, and relaxation, we find that this channel can be quite

efficient, forming IMBHs as massive as 104 M�. This upper limit assumes that (1) the BHs accrete a

substantial fraction of the stellar mass captured during each collision and (2) that the rate at which

new stars are introduced into the region near the SMBH is high enough to offset depletion by stellar

disruptions and star-star collisions. We discuss deviations from these key assumptions in the text. Our

results suggest that BHs in the pair-instability mass gap and IMBHs may be ubiquitous in galactic

centers. This formation channel has implications for observations. Collisions between stars and BHs

can produce electromagnetic signatures, for example, from x-ray binaries and tidal disruption events.

Additionally, formed through this channel, both black holes in the mass gap and IMBHs can merge

with the supermassive black hole at the center of a galactic nucleus through gravitational waves.

These gravitational wave events are extreme and intermediate mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs and IMRIs,

respectively).

1. INTRODUCTION

The recently detected gravitational wave source

GW190521 (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al.

2020a,b) produced an intermediate mass black hole of

approximately 142 M�. This event may have also had a
85 M� progenitor, which falls within the pair-instability

mass gap that limits stellar black holes (BHs) to no

more than ∼< 50 M� (e.g., Heger et al. 2003; Woosley
2017)1. Similarly, the merger products of GW150914,

GW170104, and GW170814 fall within the mass gap

(e.g., Abbott et al. 2016, 2017a,b). BH mergers that

form second generation BHs and, in some cases, inter-

mediate mass BHs (IMBHs), these gravitational wave

(GW) events can occur in globular clusters, young stel-

1 Note that the exact lower and upper limits may be sensitive to
metallicity of the progenitor (e.g., Woosley 2017; Spera & Mapelli
2017a; Limongi & Chieffi 2018a; Sakstein et al. 2020; Belczynski
et al. 2020a; Renzo et al. 2020; Vink et al. 2021).

lar clusters, or the field (e.g., Rodriguez et al. 2018; Ro-

driguez et al. 2019; Fishbach et al. 2020; Mapelli et al.

2021b,a; Di Carlo et al. 2019, 2021; Dall’Amico et al.

2021; Arca Sedda et al. 2021). However, IMBHs are

not limited to these locations and may reside in galac-
tic nuclei as well. Several studies propose that our

own galactic center may host an IMBH in the inner pc

(e.g., Hansen & Milosavljević 2003; Maillard et al. 2004;

Gürkan & Rasio 2005; Gualandris & Merritt 2009; Chen

& Liu 2013; Generozov & Madigan 2020; Fragione et al.

2020a; Zheng et al. 2020; Naoz et al. 2020; GRAVITY

Collaboration et al. 2020).

Several IMBH formation channels have been suggested

in the literature. For example, IMBHs may have a cos-

mological origin, forming in the early universe either

as a result of the very first stars (e.g., Madau & Rees

2001; Schneider et al. 2002; Johnson & Bromm 2007;

Valiante et al. 2016) or from direct collapse of accumu-

lated gas (e.g., Begelman et al. 2006; Yue et al. 2014;

Ferrara et al. 2014; Choi et al. 2015; Shlosman et al.

2016). These high redshift IMBHs would need to sur-

vive galaxy evolution and mergers to present day (e.g.,

Rashkov & Madau 2014), with significant effects on their

stellar and even dark matter surroundings (e.g., Bertone

et al. 2009; Chen & Liu 2013; Bringmann et al. 2012; Eda

et al. 2013; Naoz & Silk 2014; Naoz et al. 2019). Another

popular formation channel relies on the coalescence of

many stellar-mass black holes, which may seed objects

as massive as SMBHs (e.g., Kroupa et al. 2020). IMBHs

may form in the centers of globular clusters, where few-

body interactions lead to the merger of stellar-mass BHs

(e.g., O’Leary et al. 2006; Gürkan et al. 2006; Blecha

et al. 2006; Freitag et al. 2006; Umbreit et al. 2012; Ro-

driguez et al. 2018; Rodriguez et al. 2019; Fragione et al.

2020b). Other formation mechanisms invoke successive

collisions and mergers of massive stars (e.g., Ebisuzaki

et al. 2001; Portegies Zwart & McMillan 2002; Portegies

Zwart et al. 2004; Freitag et al. 2006; Sakurai et al. 2017;

Kremer et al. 2020; González et al. 2021; Di Carlo et al.

2021; Das et al. 2021a,b; Escala 2021).

The main obstacle to sequential BH mergers in clus-

ters is that the merger recoil velocity kick often exceeds

the escape velocity from the cluster (e.g., Schnittman

& Buonanno 2007; Centrella et al. 2010; O’Leary et al.

2006; Baibhav et al. 2020, Rom & Sari, in prep.). How-

ever, nuclear star clusters at the centers of galaxies do

not encounter this problem. For example, Fragione et al.

(2021) explore repeated BH-BH mergers in nuclear star

clusters without a SMBH. They considered BH binary-

single interactions, binary BH GW merger, and GW

merger recoil kicks. The post-kick merger product sinks

back towards the cluster center over a dynamical fric-

tion timescale. Using this approach, they showed that

103 − 104 M� IMBHs can form efficiently over the life-
time of a cluster.

However, as discussed in Section 2.2, direct BH-star

collisions are much more frequent than BH-BH collision

in galactic nuclei, making the former a promising chan-

nel for BH growth. In an N-body study of young star

clusters, Rizzuto et al. (2022) find that BH-star colli-

sions are a main contributor to the formation of BHs

in the mass gap and IMBHs. In a similar vein, Stone

et al. (2017) demonstrate that massive BHs can form

from repeated tidal encounters between stars and BHs.

More generally, several studies have explored the role of

collisions in a GN, with implications for the stellar and

red giant populations (e.g., Dale & Davies 2006; Dale

et al. 2009; Balberg et al. 2013; Mastrobuono-Battisti

et al. 2021). We propose that IMBHs can form naturally

within the central pc of a galactic center through re-

peated collisions between BHs and main sequence stars.

During a collision, the BH can accrete some portion of

the star’s mass. Over many collisions, it can grow ap-

preciably in size. We demonstrate that this channel can

create IMBHs with masses as large as 104 M�, an upper

limit that depends on the density profile of the surround-

ing stars and the efficiency of the accretion.

The paper is structured as follows: we describe rele-

vant physical processes and our approach in Section 2.

In particular, we provide an overview of collisions in

Section 2.2 and present our statistical approach in Sec-

tion 2.3. Section 2.4 discusses our treatment of the

mass growth with each collision and presents analytic

solutions to our equations in two different regimes, ef-

ficient collisions and inefficient collisions We compare

these solutions to our statistical results. Sections 2.6

and 2.8 discuss implications for GW merger events be-

tween IMBHs and the SMBH. We then incorporate re-

laxation processes and discuss the subsequent results in

Section 2.9. Finally, we discuss and summarize our find-

ings in Section 3.

2. METHODOLOGY

We consider a population of stellar mass BHs embed-

ded in a cluster of 1 M� stars. When stars and BHs

collide, the BHs can accrete mass. The growth rate de-

pends on the physical processes outlined below. We use

a statistical approach to estimate the stellar encounters

and final IMBH masses.

2.1. Physical Picture

We consider a population of BHs within the inner few

parsecs of the SMBH in a galactic nucleus (GN). We as-

sume that the BH mass distribution follows that of the

stars from which they originate, a Kroupa initial mass

function dN/dm ∝ m−2.35. While this choice represents
a gross oversimplification, it has very little bearing on

our final results. Future work may address the particu-

lars of the BH mass distribution, but we do not expect

that it will significantly alter the outcome. The upper

and lower limits of the BH mass distribution are 5 and

50M�, respectively. We select the upper limit to en-

compass the range of upper bounds predicted by stellar

evolution models, which vary between 40 and 125M�
depending on the metallicity (Heger et al. 2003; Woosley

2017; Spera & Mapelli 2017b; Limongi & Chieffi 2018b;

Belczynski et al. 2020b; Renzo et al. 2020). We assume

that the orbits of the BHs follow a thermal eccentricity

distribution. We draw their semimajor axes, a•, from a

uniform distribution in log distance, dN/d(log r) being

constant. While this distribution is not necessarily rep-

resentative of actual conditions in the GN, we use it to

build a comprehensive physical picture of BH growth at

all distances from the SMBH, including within 0.01 pc.

Otherwise, the innermost region of the GN would be

poorly represented in our sample. We consider other

Figure 1. We plot the relevant timescales, including col-
lision (green), relaxation (gold), and BH-BH GW capture
(purple), for a single BH in the GN as a function of distance
from the SMBH. For the collision timescale, we assume the
BH is on a circular orbit. The timescales depend on the
density, so we adopt a range of density profiles, bounded by
α = 1 (dashed curve) to α = 2 (dark, solid curve). The dark
blue line represents the time for a 105 M� BH to merge with
the SMBH through GW emission.

observationally motivated distributions in Section 2.9,

but reserve a more detailed examination of the distribu-

tion’s impact for future work.

2.2. Direct Collisions

BHs in the GN can undergo direct collisions with other

objects. The timescale for this process, tcoll, can be es-

timated using a simple rate calculation: t−1coll = nσA,

where n is the number density of objects, σ is the ve-

locity dispersion, and A is the cross-section. We use the

collision timescale from Rose et al. (2020):

t−1coll =πn(a•)σ(a•)

×
(
f1(e•)r

2
c + f2(e•)rc

2G(mBH +m?)

σ(a•)2

)
. (1)

where G is the gravitational constant and rc is the sum

of the radii of the interacting objects, a black hole with

mass mBH and a star with mass m?. Detailed in Rose

et al. (2020), f1(e•) and f2(e•) account for the effect of

the eccentricity of the BH’s orbit about the SMBH on

the collision rate, while n and σ are simply evaluated

at the semimajor axis of the orbit (see below). Note

that this timescale equation includes the effects of grav-

itational focusing, which enhances the cross-section of

interaction.

Assuming a circular orbit for simplicity, we plot the

timescale for a BH orbiting in the GN to collide with

a 1M� star as a function of distance from the SMBH

in Figure 1.2 As this timescale depends on the density

of surrounding stars, we adopt a density profile of the

form:

ρ(r•) = ρ0

(
r•
r0

)−α
, (2)

where r• denotes the distance from the SMBH. We adopt

a SMBH mass of 4× 106 M� such that our fiducial GN
matches our own galactic center (e.g., Ghez et al. 2005;

Genzel et al. 2003). In this case, the normalization in

Eq. (2) is ρ0 = 1.35× 106M�/pc3 at r0 = 0.25 pc (Gen-
zel et al. 2010). Additionally, in Eq. (2), α gives the

slope of the power law. We assume that a uniform pop-

ulation of solar mass stars account for most of the mass

in the GN, making the stellar number density:

n(r•) =
ρ(r•)

1M�
. (3)

The collision timescale also depends on the velocity dis-

persion, which we express as:

σ(r•) =

√
GM•

r•(1 + α)
, (4)

where α is the slope of the density profile and M• de-

notes the mass of the SMBH (Alexander 1999; Alexan-

der & Pfuhl 2014). As mentioned above, Eq. (1) depends

on the sum of the radii of the colliding objects, rc. We

take rc = 1R� because these interactions involve a BH

and a star, and the former has a much smaller physi-

cal cross-section. For example, the Schwarzschild radius

of a 10M� BH is only 30 km, or 4.31 × 10−5R�. For
this reason, direct collisions between compact objects

are very rare and not included in our model.

We note that direct collisions between BHs, via GW

emission, were shown to be efficient in nuclear star clus-

ters without SMBHs (e.g., Portegies Zwart & McMil-

lan 2000; O’Leary et al. 2006; Rodriguez et al. 2016).

However, in the GN, star-BH collisions are much more

frequent than direct BH-BH collisions. As depicted in

Figure 1, the star-BH collision timescale for a range

of density profiles is many orders of magnitude shorter

than the BH-BH GW collision timescale (for the rele-

vant equations, see O’Leary et al. 2009; Gondán et al.

2018, for example). Thus, we expect that star-BH col-

lisions will be the main driver of IMBH growth in the

GN.

2 We note that the eccentricity has a very minor effect on the
collision timescale (Rose et al. 2020).

2.3. Statistical Approach to Collisions

We simulate the mass growth of a population of BHs

with initial conditions detailed in Section 2.1. Over an

increment ∆t of 106 yr, we calculate the probability of

a collision occurring, given by ∆t/tcoll. This choice of

∆t is motivated by our galactic center’s star formation

timescale (e.g., Lu et al. 2009), allowing for regular re-

plenishment of the stellar population in the GN. We have

checked that the results are not sensitive to this choice

of ∆t, omitted here to avoid clutter. We draw a number

between 0 and 1 using a random number generator. If

that number is less than or equal to the probability, we

increase the BH’s mass by ∆m, the mass that the BH is

expected to accrete in a single collision (see Section 2.4

for details). We recalculate the collision timescale using

the updated BH mass and repeat this process until the

time elapsed equals the simulation time of 10 Gyr3.

2.4. Mass Growth

When a BH collides with a star, it may accrete ma-

terial and grow in mass. The details of the accretion

depend on the relative velocity between the BH and

star. For simplicity, this calculation assumes that the

two objects experience a head on collision, with the BH

passing through the star’s center. We begin by con-

sidering the escape velocity from the BH at the star’s

outermost point, its surface, which corresponds to the

maximum impact parameter 1 R�. Qualitatively, one

might expect that the BH could capture the entire star

(i.e., ∆m ∼ 1 M�) if the relative velocity is smaller than
the escape velocity from the BH at this point. However,

in the vicinity of the SMBH, the dispersion velocity of

the stars may be much larger than the escape velocity

from the BH at the star’s surface. In this case, the BH

captures a “tunnel” of material through the star. This

tunnel has radius equal to the Bondi radius and length

approximately 1R�. For the purposes of this study, we

assume that the BH accretes all of the material that

it captures. The details of the accretion are uncertain,

however, and it may be much less efficient than our re-

sults imply. We discuss accretion in Section 2.5.

To estimate ∆m, we begin with the Bondi-Hoyle ac-

cretion rate, ṁ, given by:

ṁ =
4πG2m2BHρstar

(c2s + σ
2)

3/2
, (5)

3 Closer to the SMBH, ∆t may exceed the collision timescale by
a factor of a few for steep density profiles. We include a safe-
guard in our code which takes the ratio tcoll/∆t and rounds it
to the nearest integer. We take this integer to be the number of
collisions and increase the BH mass accordingly.

Figure 2. We consider an example that highlights the mass
growth as a function of distance from the SMBH. Grey dots
represent the initial masses and distances from the SMBH
of the BHs involved in the simulation. For simplicity, we set
the inital mass equal to 10M� for all of the BHs. Assuming
the density profile of stars has α = 1, we consider two cases:
BHs accrete all of the star’s mass during a collision (red) and
only a portion of the star’s mass is accreted during a collision
given by Eq. 6 (blue). The latter case results in less growth
closer to the SMBH where the velocity dispersion becomes
high. The shaded regions and dashed lines represent the
analytical predictions detailed in Section 2.4.

where cs is the speed of sound in the star and ρstar is its

density (e.g., Bondi 1952; Bondi & Hoyle 1944; Shima

et al. 1985; Edgar 2004, see latter for a review). We

approximate the density as 1M�/(4πR
3
�/3) and take

the conservative value of cs = 500 km s
−1, which is

consistent with the sound speed inside a 1 M� star

(Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 1996) and allows us to set

a lower limit on ∆m. To find ∆m, at each collision, we

have:

∆m = min(ṁ× t?,cross, 1 M�) , (6)

where t?,cross ∼ R�/σ is the crossing time of the BH in
the star. We take the minimum between ṁ× t?,cross and
1 M� because the BH cannot accrete more mass than

one star at each collision.

Figure 2 juxtaposes the expected growth using Bondi-

Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion (blue small points) with a

much simpler model in which the BH accretes the star’s

entire mass, 1M� (red large points). Both examples

start with identical populations of 10M� BHs (grey)

and simulate growth through collisions using a statisti-

cal approach. As the BHs grow, the collision timescale,

which depends on mBH , decreases. Simultaneously,

∆m, which also depends on mBH , increases. The re-

sult is exponential growth (see discussion and details

surrounding Eq. (8)). In Figure 2, however, the simula-

tions assume α = 1 for the stellar density profile, ensur-

ing the collision timescale is long compared to the sim-



IMBH Formation in Galactic Nuclei 5

ulation time, 10 Gyr. Therefore, the BHs grow slowly,

and their final masses can be approximated using the

following equation:

mfinal(tcoll → const.) =minitial + ∆m
T

tcoll
, (7)

in which T represents the simulation time and ∆m and

tcoll remain constant, approximated as their initial val-

ues.

This equation is plotted in Figure 2 for both cases,

∆m = 1M� (red) and ∆m from Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton

accretion (blue), and the curves coincide with the cor-

responding simulated results. The shaded regions rep-

resent one standard deviation from Eq. (7), calculated

using the square root of the number of collisions, T/tcoll.

As indicated by the results in red, in the absence of

Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion, the BHs closest to the

SMBH experience the most growth because they have

shorter collision timescales. However, Bondi-Hoyle-

Lyttleton accretion becomes important closer to the

SMBH, where the velocity dispersion is large compared

with the stars’ escape velocity, and curtails the mass

growth for BHs in this region. Outside of 10−2 pc, a BH

consumes the star’s entire mass: the accretion-limited

∆m governed by Eq. (7) is greater than or equal to the

star’s mass.

Eq. 7 does not apply for other values of α. When the

collision timescale is shorter, corresponding to a larger

index α in the density profile (see Figure 1), the growth

is very efficient and ∆m quickly approaches 1 M�. Con-

sequently, while we can now assume ∆m = 1 M�, we

can no longer assume the collision timescale is constant.

The final mass grows exponentially as a result. For

∆m = 1M�, the general solution is reached by solving

the differential equation dm/dt = 1M�/tcoll(m), which

gives:

mfinal(∆m→ 1 M�) =−A+ (minitial +A) eCT (8)

where A = σ2Rstar/G and C = 2πGnstarRstar/σ. As an

example, we plot this curve in purple for the α = 2 case,

in Figure 3, which agrees with the simulated masses.

2.5. Uncertainties in Accretion

We note that the ∆M calculated in this proof-of-

concept study assumes that the BH accretes all of the

material that it captures. Estimating the true fraction

of the material accreted by the BH is very challeng-

ing; this complex problem requires numerically solving

the generalized GR fluid equations with cooling, heat-

ing, and radiative transfer, etc. and remains an active

field of research (e.g., Blandford & Begelman 1999; Park

& Ostriker 2001; Narayan et al. 2003; Igumenshchev

et al. 2003; Ohsuga et al. 2005; Yuan et al. 2012; Jiang

et al. 2014; McKinney et al. 2014; Narayan et al. 2022).

Heuristically, if a collision between a BH and a star re-

sults in an accretion disk, the disk’s viscous timescale

may be as low as days. The resultant luminosity can

unbind most of the captured material, though details

such as the amount accreted and peak luminosity re-

main uncertain (e.g., Yuan et al. (2012); Jiang et al.

(2014), see also the discussion in Stone et al. (2017),

Rizzuto et al. (2022), and Kremer et al. (2022)). The

question becomes whether or not a BH can still accu-

mulate significant amounts of mass over many collisions

even if it accretes very little in a single one. We ex-

plore the viability of our channel using a physically mo-

tivated inefficient accretion model. Several studies have

invoked momentum-driven winds in BH accretion (e.g.,

Murray et al. 2005; Ostriker et al. 2010; Brennan et al.

2018). We thus estimate the fraction of captured mass

accreted to be approximately vesc/(cη), where vesc is

the escape velocity from the BH at 1 R� and η is the

accretion efficiency at the ISCO. We take η to be 0.1

(e.g., Yu & Tremaine 2002). This expression for the

fraction accreted is consistent with Kremer et al. (2022)

equation 19 for s = 0.5, which is a reasonable value for

s, a free parameter between 0.2 and 0.8. We discuss

the results of the momentum-driven winds estimate in

Section 3. We note that the accretion process may be

more efficient than this estimate implies if, for example,

jets or other instabilities result in the beaming of radi-

ation away from the captured material (e.g., Blandford

& Znajek 1977; Begelman 1979; De Villiers et al. 2005;

McKinney & Gammie 2004; McKinney 2006; Igumen-

shchev 2008; Begelman 2012a,b; McKinney et al. 2014).

2.6. GW Inspiral

When a BH is close to the SMBH, GW emission can

circularize and shrink its orbit. We implement the ef-

fects of GW emission on the BH’s semimajor axis and

eccentricity following Peters & Mathews (1963a). The

characteristic timescale to merge a BH with an SMBH

is given by:

where f(e•) is a function of e•. For all values of e•,

f(e•) is between 0.979 and 1.81 (Blaes et al. 2002). We

plot this timescale for a 1 × 105M� BH in Figure 1 in
blue.



6 Rose et al.

Figure 3. On the right, we plot final masses of 500 BHs using different values of α in the density profile, shallow (α = 1) to
cuspy (α = 2). For the latter case, the purple line shows the analytical result from Eq. 8, taking minitial to be the average mass
of the population. Faded stars indicate BHs that merged with the SMBH through GWs. On the left, we plot the masses and
merger times of these BHs.

In our simulations, we assume a BH has merged with

the SMBH when the condition tGW < telapsed is met.

When this condition is satisfied, we terminate mass

growth through collisions for that BH.4

2.7. IMBH growth

As detailed above, BH-stellar collisions can increase

the BH masses as a function of time. Here, we examine

the sensitivity of the BH growth to the density power

law. From Eq. (1), it is clear that the growth rate de-

pends on the stellar density profile, governed by the in-

dex α. We expect that higher values of α, or steeper

profiles, will result in more efficient mass growth. In

Figure 1, larger values of α lead to collision timescales

in the GN’s inner region, inwards of 0.25 pc, that are

much smaller that the 10 Gyr simulation time. Figure 3

confirms this expectation. It depicts the mass growth of

a uniform distribution of BHs with initial conditions de-

tailed in Section 2.1 for five α values, spanning 1 (green)

to 2 (purple). The most massive IMBHs form inwards

of 0.25 pc for the α = 2 case.

2.8. Gravitational Wave Mergers and Intermediate

and Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral Candidates

Towards the SMBH, efficient collisions can create BHs

massive enough to merge with the SMBH through GWs.

Following the method detailed in Section 2.6, when a

given BH meets the criterion tGW < telapsed, we mark

4 For comparison, we also incrementally changed the semimajor
axis and eccentricity from GW emission following the equations
in Peters & Mathews (1963b). This method leads to a slight
increase in the final IMBH masses because it accounts for the
collisions that take place while the orbit is gradually shrinking.

it as merged with the SMBH. We assume that at this

point the dynamics of the BH will be determined by GW

emission, shrinking and circularizing the BHs orbit un-

til it undergoes an extreme or intermediate mass ratio

inspiral (EMRI and IMRI, respectively). The righthand

plot in Figure 3 shows the BH masses versus time of

merger. It is interesting to note that even in the ab-

sence of relaxation processes, which are often invoked

to explain the formation of EMRIs, EMRIs and notably

IMRIs can form in this region.

2.9. Two Body Relaxation Processes

A BH orbiting the SMBH experiences weak gravita-

tional interactions with other objects in the GN. Over a

relaxation time, these interactions alter its orbit about

the SMBH. The two-body relaxation timescale for a

single-mass system is:

trelax = 0.34
σ3

G2ρ〈M∗〉 ln Λrlx
, (10)

where ln Λrlx is the Coulomb logarithm and 〈M∗〉 is the
average mass of the surrounding objects, here assumed

to be 1M� (Spitzer 1987; Binney & Tremaine 2008,

Eq. (7.106)). This equation represents the approximate

timescale for a BH on a semi-circular orbit to change

its orbital energy and angular momentum by order of

themselves. The BH experiences diffusion in its angular

momentum and energy as a function of time (depending

on the eccentricity of the orbit, this process can be more

efficient Fragione & Sari 2018; Sari & Fragione 2019).

Relaxation can cause the orbit of an object in a GN to

reach high eccentricities. If the object is a BH, it can

spiral into the SMBH and form an EMRI, while a star



IMBH Formation in Galactic Nuclei 7

can be tidally disrupted by the SMBH (e.g. Magorrian

& Tremaine 1999; Wang & Merritt 2004; Hopman &

Alexander 2005; Aharon & Perets 2016; Stone & Met-

zger 2016; Amaro-Seoane 2018; Sari & Fragione 2019;

Naoz et al. 2022). The relaxation process is therefore

crucial to our study. In Figure 1, we plot the relaxation

timescale in gold for a range of α. We note that the Bah-

call & Wolf (1976) profile, α = 7/4, corresponds to zero

net flux and therefore does not preferentially migrate

objects inward.

Additionally, because BHs are more massive on av-

erage than the surrounding objects, they are expected

to segregate inwards in the GN (e.g., Shapiro &

Marchant 1978; Cohn & Kulsrud 1978; Morris 1993;

Miralda-Escudé & Gould 2000; Baumgardt et al. 2004).

They sink toward the SMBH on the mass segregation

timescale, tseg ≈ 〈M∗〉/mBH × trelax (e.g., Spitzer 1987;
Fregeau et al. 2002; Merritt 2006), which is typically an

order of magnitude smaller than the relaxation timescale

plotted in Figure 1.

We incorporate relaxation processes by introducing a

small change in the BH’s energy and angular momen-

tum each time it orbits the SMBH. We apply a small

instantaneous velocity kick to the BH, denoted as ∆v.

We draw ∆v from a Guassian distribution with average

of zero and a standard deviation of ∆vrlx/
√

3, where

∆vrlx = v•
√
P•/trlx (see Bradnick et al. 2017, for an

approach to changes in the angular momentum). The

new orbital parameters can be calculated following Lu

& Naoz (2019), and see Naoz et al. (2022) for the full

set of equations.

We account for the effects of relaxation processes,

including mass-segregation, using a multi-faceted ap-

proach. We begin by migrating each BH towards the

center over its mass-segregation timescale, shifting it in-

crementally inward such that its orbital energy changes

by order of itself within the segregation timescale.

As the BHs segregate down the potential well, their

abundance with respect to stars increases, until at some

turnover radius, BHs become the dominant source of

scattering for both black holes and stars. Within this ra-

dius, BH self-interaction dominates over two-body scat-

terings with the now rarer main-sequence stars. The

BHs will then settle onto a Bahcall-Wolf profile, while

the stars may follow a shallower profile, with approx-

imately n? ∝ r−1.5, inwards of the transition radius
(Linial & Sari in prep.).

Therefore, after the initial mass segregation, we allow

the BHs to begin diffusing over a relaxation timescale,

their orbital parameters changing slowly through a ran-

dom process. In this random process, some of the BHs

may migrate closer to the SMBH. We terminate mass

growth when the BH enters the inner 200 au of the GN,

within which the density of stars is uncertain. This cut-

off is based on the 120 au pericenter of S0-2, the closest

known star to the SMBH (e.g., Ghez et al. 2005).

Another physical process that causes inward migra-

tion is dynamical friction. A cursory derivation based

on the dynamical friction equations described in Binney

& Tremaine (2008) reveals the process to have a simi-

lar timescale to mass segregation. If a BH diffuses to

a distance greater than 2 pc from the SMBH, exiting

the sphere of influence, we have it sink inwards, back

towards the center, over a dynamical friction timescale.

After one dynamical friction timescale has passed, we

restart diffusion.

We note that our prescription ignores self-interactions

between the BHs. As mentioned above, as the BHs sink

towards the SMBH, their concentration in the inner re-

gion of the GN increases, allowing them to dominate the

scattering. We reserve the inclusion of these interactions

for future study.

2.10. Effect of Relaxation Processes

As depicted in Figure 4, two-body relaxation processes

result in more EMRIs and IMRIs events. These pro-

cesses allow BHs that begin further from the SMBH

to migrate inwards and grow more efficiently in mass.

However, it also impedes the growth of BHs that are

initially closer to the SMBH by allowing them to dif-

fuse out of the inner region where collisions are efficient.

As can be seen in Figure 4, the net result is that more

BHs grow, but the maximum mass is lower compared

to the scenario that ignores two-body relaxation. The

histogram in Figure 4 presents the final BH mass distri-

butions for different power law indices α. As expected,

the two-body relaxation suppresses the α dependence

highlighted in Figure 3. In fact, using a KS test, we

find that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the two

distributions were drawn from the same sample for the

α = 1.75 and α = 2 results. Interestingly, a BH mass

IMF with an average of 10 M� leads to a final distri-

bution with an average of ∼ 200 M� and a median of
∼ 45 M�, which lies within the mass gap.

3. DISCUSSION AND PREDICTIONS

We explore the feasibility of forming IMBHs in a

GN through successive collisions between a stellar-mass

BH and main-sequence stars. Taking both a statisti-

cal and analytic approach, we show that this channel

can produce IMBHs efficiently with masses as high as

103−4 M� and may result in many IMBH-SMBH merg-

ers (intermediate-mass ratio inspirals, or IMRIs) and

EMRIs.

Figure 4. Similar to Figure 3, we plot the initial masses versus initial distance (grey) and final mass versus final distance
(red) for 500 BHs. This simulation includes relaxation processes, including mass segregation, diffusion, and dynamical friction.
We assume α = 1.75 for the GN density profile. Faded stars represent BHs that merge with the SMBH. As a result of inward
migration, BHs merge more quickly with the SMBH, before they can become as massive as those in Figure 3. Additionally,
more BHs become EMRIs and IMRIs. Additionally, in the third panel, we show a histogram of the simulated IMBH masses
for two different values of α, 1.5 (orange, solid), α, 1.75 (red, dashed), and 2 (purple, dash-dotted), accounting for relaxation
processes. We also show the results for a simulation with α = 1.75 that accounts for momentum-driven winds (black, dotted).
Despite the substantially reduced accretion, BHs in the mass gap still form.

As the stellar mass BH collides with a star, the BH

will grow in mass. The increase may equal star’s en-

tire mass if the relative velocity is smaller than the es-

cape velocity from the BH at 1 R�. However, near the

SMBH, the velocity dispersion may be larger than the

escape velocity from the BH at the star’s radius. In this

limit, the BH captures a “tunnel” of material through

the star, estimated using Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accre-

tion. In our statistical analysis, we account for Bondi-

Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion and find that BHs outside of

10−2 pc from the SMBH can capture the entire star (see

Figure 2).

The efficiency of collisions, and therefore IMBH,

EMRI, and IMRI formation as well, are sensitive to

the underlying stellar density. As shown in Figure 3, a

steeper density profile results in larger IMBHs. This be-

havior can be understood from the collision timescale’s

dependence on the stellar density profile. A steeper pro-

file yields shorter collision timescales near the SMBH.

However, the inclusion of relaxation processes in the

simulations dampens the influence of the stellar density

profile by allowing BHs to diffuse into regions of more

or less efficient growth. As a result, more BHs grow in

mass, but their maximum mass is smaller (∼ 104 M�).
Additionally, the final masses have no apparent depen-

dence on distance from the SMBH (see Figure 4).

Most simulations in our study assume that the BHs

accrete all of the mass that they capture. The final BH

masses can be taken as an upper limit. We note that

the accretion is a highly uncertain process and repre-

sents an active field of study (e.g., Blandford & Begel-

man 1999; Park & Ostriker 2001; Narayan et al. 2003;

Igumenshchev et al. 2003; Ohsuga et al. 2005; Yuan

et al. 2012; Jiang et al. 2014; McKinney et al. 2014;

Narayan et al. 2022). To assess the limits of our model,

we also consider a physically motivated accretion model,

momentum-driven winds (Section 2.5). We present the

final mass distribution for momentum-driven winds in

Figure 4. Importantly, we find that BHs within the

mass gap still form naturally despite the substantially

reduced accretion. About 5% of the BHs grow by 10

to 100 M�. Furthermore, if we increase this ∆M esti-

mate by a factor of 2 (i.e., use η = 0.05), the simula-

tion produces a 3.5× 103 M� IMBH for the same initial
conditions. Our proof-of-concept demonstrates that col-

lisions between BH and stars are an important process

that should be taken into account in dense places such

as a GN.

Mass growth through BH-main-sequence star colli-

sions may act in concert with other IMBH formation

channels, such as compact object binary mergers (e.g.,

Hoang et al. 2018; Stephan et al. 2019; Fragione et al.

2021; Wang et al. 2021). While in some cases colli-

sions can unbind a binary (e.g., Sigurdsson & Phinney

1993; Fregeau et al. 2004), BH binaries can be tightly

bound enough to withstand the collisions. Wide bina-

ries may also become unbound due to interactions with

the neighboring stars and compact objects (e.g., Binney

& Tremaine 1987; Rose et al. 2020, see latter study for

the timescale for an arbitrary eccentricity). However,

as highlighted in previous studies, a substantial frac-

tion of these binaries may merge due to the Eccentric

Kozai Lidov mechanism, leaving behind a single star or

a single compact object (e.g., Stephan et al. 2016, 2019;

Hoang et al. 2018). Additionally, to be susceptible to

evaporation, BH binaries must have a wider configura-

tion. Otherwise, they will be more tightly bound than

the average kinetic energy of the surrounding objects

and will only harden through weak gravitational inter-



IMBH Formation in Galactic Nuclei 9

actions with neighboring stars (see for example Figure

6 in Rose et al. 2020).

We note that we assume a steady-state and treat the

stars as a reservoir in this model. Future work will take a

more nuanced approach to the background stars, whose

density as a function of time can be influenced by several

factors. Firstly, the relaxation of the stellar population

occurs on Gyr timescales. Some studies have suggested

that in situ star formation can occur in the Galactic

Center as close as 0.04 pc from the SMBH (e.g., Levin

& Beloborodov 2003; Paumard et al. 2006), and star

formation episodes can occur as often as every ∼ 5 Myr
(e.g. Lu et al. 2009). Therefore, we expect that after

the first Gyr, stars within . 0.01 pc will be replenished
at intervals consistent with the star formation episodes;

the infalling populations of stars are separated by ∼
5−10 Myr, which is shorter than the collision timescale.

However, star-star collisions may complicate this pic-

ture within ∼ 0.01 pc. As discussed above, regular star
formation ensures the BHs always have a stellar popula-

tion to interact with outside of ∼ 0.01 pc.5 At 0.01 pc,
however, the kinetic energy during a collision between

two 1 M� stars is larger than their binding energies.

Collisions can therefore thin out the stellar populations

during the time it takes them to diffuse to these small

radii, . 0.01 pc, and may reduce the BH growth in the
innermost region. We reserve the inclusion of star-star

collisions for future work. We also note that the disrup-

tion of binary stars by the SMBH may help replenish

the stellar population even as collisions work to deplete

it (e.g., Balberg et al. 2013); when a binary is disrupted,

one of the stars is captured on a tightly bound orbit

about the SMBH.

An IMBH may also affect the stellar density profile.

As it spirals into the SMBH, it can perturb stellar orbits,

and these interactions can lead to hypervelocity stars

(e.g., Baumgardt et al. 2006a; Löckmann & Baumgardt

2008). Löckmann & Baumgardt (2008) show that an

IMBH can modify an initially steep stellar density pro-

file to become consistent with the flatter cusp observed

in the Galactic Center. The stars may then be replen-

ished on 100 Myr timescales (Baumgardt et al. 2006a).

Therefore, after the formation of the first few IMBHs,

subsequent BH growth may occur in bursts, coinciding

with replenishment of the stars.

While there are many competing dynamical processes

that shape the stellar density profile, we stress that α

5 In fact, the star-star collision timescale is greater than 10 Myr
for the entire parameter space, save at 0.001 pc for larger values
of α; the BH-star collision timescale plotted in Fig. 1 is the same
order of magnitude as the star-star collision timescale.

can simply be chosen to encapsulate all of the relevant

physics. A value for α that is constrained by observa-

tions must already reflect ongoing processes like star-

star collisions and replenishment. Schödel et al. (2018)

find the observed stellar mass enclosed within 0.01 pc of

the Milky Way’s Galactic Center to be approximately

180 M�. This estimate is consistent to order of magni-

tude with our α = 1.25 case. In a simulation like those

depicted in Figure 4, which include relaxation, α = 1.25

leads to a maximum IMBH mass of 140 M�. Further-

more, while the stellar mass within 0.01 pc may be a

few hundred M�, Do et al. (2019) and GRAVITY Col-

laboration et al. (2020) set an upper limit on the mass

enclosed within the orbit of S0-2 to be about a few thou-

sand M�, or 0.1% of the central mass. This upper limit

can include mass that was previously in stars but is now

in BHs. In that case, the 180 M� is what remains of the

stars, while BHs and IMBHs make up the ∼ 1000 M�
in the innermost region.

Also not included in this study, collisions between the

BH and other compact objects will increase the BH

growth rate. BH-BH mergers (e.g., O’Leary et al. 2009;

Fragione et al. 2021) and even neutron star BH mergers

(e.g., Hoang et al. 2020) become more likely as the BHs

increase in mass through stellar collisions. As a result,

the BH-BH collision timescale, discussed in Section 2.2,

will become relevant to our simulations, allowing the

BHs to grow through this channel in addition to stel-

lar collisions. Additionally, this compact object mergers

result in GW recoil, which may have a large impact on

the dynamics (e.g., Baibhav et al. 2020; Fragione et al.

2021).

The BH’s mass growth increases GW emission, which

dissipates energy from the orbit. Along with relaxation,

GW emission causes BHs to sink towards the SMBH

and eventually undergo a merger. As a result, the GN
environment is conducive to the formation of EMRIs

and IMRIs. The GW emission from EMRIs and IM-

RIs is expected to be at mHz frequencies, making them

promising candidates for LISA to observe. While the

exact rate calculation is beyond the scope of this study,

the mechanism outlined here seems very promising.

Our results also suggest that BHs within the mass gap

as well as IMBHs likely exist in many galactic nuclei, as

well as within our own galactic center. This implication

seems to be consistent with recent observational and

theoretical studies (e.g., Hansen & Milosavljević 2003;

Maillard et al. 2004; Gürkan & Rasio 2005; Gualandris

& Merritt 2009; Chen & Liu 2013; Generozov & Madi-

gan 2020; Fragione et al. 2020a; Zheng et al. 2020; Naoz

et al. 2020; GRAVITY Collaboration et al. 2020).



10 Rose et al.

Lastly, the collisions between stellar mass BHs and

stars may contribute to the x-ray emission from our

galactic centre (e.g., Muno et al. 2005, 2009; Hailey

et al. 2018; Zhu et al. 2018; Cheng et al. 2018, see Kre-

mer et al. (2022) for a discussion of electromagnetic sig-

natures from BH-star collisions)6. These interactions,

in particular grazing collisions, may also result in tidal

disruption events (e.g., Baumgardt et al. 2006b; Perets

et al. 2016; Stone et al. 2017; Samsing et al. 2019; Kre-

mer et al. 2021). Thus, the process outlined here may

produce electromagnetic signatures in addition to GW

mergers.
