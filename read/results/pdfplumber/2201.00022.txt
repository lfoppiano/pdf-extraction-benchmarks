2 ABSTRACT

Most stellar evolution models predict that black holes (BHs) should not exist above approximately
0
50−70 M , the lower limit of the pair-instability mass gap. However, recent LIGO/Virgo detections

  indicate the existence of BHs with masses at and above this threshold. We suggest that massive
l
u BHs, including intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), can form in galactic nuclei through collisions
J between stellar-mass black holes and the surrounding main-sequence stars. Considering dynamical
 
6 processes such as collisions, mass segregation, and relaxation, we ﬁnd that this channel can be quite
 
  eﬃcient, forming IMBHs as massive as 104 M . This upper limit assumes that (1) the BHs accrete a

(red) for 500 BHs. This simulation includes relaxation processes, including mass segregation, diﬀusion, and dynamical friction.
We assume α=1.75 for the GN density proﬁle. Faded stars represent BHs that merge with the SMBH. As a result of inward
migration, BHs merge more quickly with the SMBH, before they can become as massive as those in Figure 3. Additionally,
more BHs become EMRIs and IMRIs. Additionally, in the third panel, we show a histogram of the simulated IMBH masses
for two diﬀerent values of α, 1.5 (orange, solid), α, 1.75 (red, dashed), and 2 (purple, dash-dotted), accounting for relaxation
processes. We also show the results for a simulation with α=1.75 that accounts for momentum-driven winds (black, dotted).

in particular grazing collisions, may also result in tidal
